# Compatibility
I used Mixins to make Embers Unofficial Extended Life compatible with as many mods as possible, while also fixing a few issues I encountered during my testing. Here is a changelog for the compatibility mixins:

## [Aetherium Ashen Armor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aetherium-ashen-armor)
- redirect all calls from the old `RegistryManager` to `ItemRegiser`

## [Applied Engergistics 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ae2-extended-life)
- the Tiny TNT now respects the Explosion Charm

## [Applied Integrations](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-integrations)
- redirect all calls from the old `RegistryManager` to `ItemRegiser`

## [Emberforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emberforged)
- prior version `2.0.0`
  - redirect all calls from the old `RegistryManager` to `FluidRegister`, `ItemRegiser` and `BlockRegiser`
  - respect my fluid to ingot ratio when creating its recipes
- after version `2.0.0`
  - Emberforged now depends on our Embers fork
  - that means it's now compatible out of the box
- mixins will automatically disable themselves if Emberforged is version `2.0.0` or higher

- removed the empty "test" research category in the ancient codex
